Tender MultiPass
===============

Easily add auto-login cookie values for Tender (http://tenderapp.com)

Setup (Unencrypted Cookie Values)
=====

* Install the plugin, and include the Tender::MultiPassMethods into your user model
* Set up these 3 values:  Tender::MultiPass.site_key, 
  Tender::MultiPass.cookie_domain, and Tender::MultiPass.support_domain
* Use @user.tender_multipass(cookies) to modify cookies inside your controller request.

The 3 required cookie values (tender_email, tender_hash, and tender_expires) are all taken care of for you.  
You can also set three special cookies to further identify users: tender_name, tender_external_id, and tender_external_url.  
These specify some text and an optional link that display next to users created by the automatic logging feature.  
This is needed when you may have multiple users from different areas of your app that might have the same email address.  
This is a potential issue in web applications that separate user accounts by some top level structure like Account or Company.

Example (Rails, Unencrypted Cookie Values)
=======

# /config/initializers/tender_multi_pass.rb
# ensure the plugin class is loaded before proceeding
Tender::MultiPass.class_eval do
  self.site_key       = "abc"
  self.support_domain = "help.xoo.com"
  self.cookie_domain  = ".xoo.com"
end

# /app/models/user.rb
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Tender::MultiPassMethods

  # Use this block to define a default hash for all Tender multipasses.
  tender_multipass do |user|
    {:external_id => user.company.id, :account_balance => user.balance,
    # you can specify :name and :email if your model uses different attribute names
     :name => user.login, :email => user.email_address}
  end
end

# /app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController
  def login
    if user = User.authenticate(params[:login], params[:password])
      # default method of creating a tender multipass
      user.tender_multipass(cookies, 1.week.from_now)

      # use a hash to set the expiration
      user.tender_multipass(cookies, :expires => 1.week.from_now)

      # specify custom tender_* cookies.
      # These will be shown in the tender discussion to the support users only
      # This adds a tender_account_balance cookie:
      user.tender_multipass(cookies, :account_balance => user.balance)
      
      # fill in the profile's visible name field by sending the field name
      user.tender_multipass(cookies, :name_field => :login)

      # fill in the profile's visible name field by sending the name
      user.tender_multipass(cookies, :name => user.login)
    end
    redirect_to "/"
  end

  def logout
    user.tender_expire(cookies) if user
    redirect_to "/"
  end
end

If you want to have Tender redirect to your site's login form and can't/don't want to use domain cookies you can just pass the variables in the URL. 
  
  Tender -> click "login" -> goes to your site -> returns to Tender with URL params
  
Your login action should also check to see if the user is already logged in, so you can just bounce them back to Tender.
You can implement this something like:

# /app/controllers/sessions_controller.rb
class SessionsController
  def login
    if logged_in? || current_user = User.authenticate(params[:login], params[:password])
      if params[:tender]
        auth = current_user.tender_multipass({}, 1.week.from_now.to_i)
        redirect_to "http://your.tenderapp.com/login?email=#{auth[:tender_email][:value]}&expires=#{auth[:tender_expires][:value]}&hash=#{auth[:tender_hash][:value]}"
      else
        redirect_to "/"
      end
    end
  end
end


Notes
=====

* It is assumed User#email is available
* When testing, you must use strings rather than symbols to check for the cookies

  assert_equal ['hello@example.com'], response.cookies['tender_email']
